Each user has their own collection of applications, providing a clear ownership model and simplified security rules. The `applications` subcollection under each user document ensures that only the user can access and modify their own application data. This design adheres to the principle of Authorization Independence by avoiding dependencies on parent document data within the rules. All data required to authorize a request is available within the application document itself, allowing for atomic operations and easier debugging. This design supports secure list operations (QAPs) by scoping application data to individual users."
